# ariporad.zsh-theme

A theme based off [agnoster](https://gist.github.com/agnoster/3712874), but
without powerline or backgrounds.

This README is copy and pasted from agnoster's, with some modifications.

For Mac users, I highly reccomend [iTerm 2](https://www.iterm2.com/).

## What does it show?

If the previous command failed (✘)
- User @ Hostname (if user is not DEFAULT_USER, which can then be set in your profile)
- Git status
  - Current branch / SHA1 in detached head state
  - Dirty working directory (color change)
- Working directory
- Elevated (root) privileges (⚡)
- Background tasks are running (⚙)

## iTerm 2 v3

For iTerm2 v3, some extra care is taken to make sure everything looks good (expecially the mark).

## Installation 

Put ariporad.zsh-theme wherever your sytem puts .zsh-themes.


## Future Work

I don't want to clutter it up too much, but I am toying with the idea of nvm (node.js version) display.
